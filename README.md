I am currently working in the mountains in Austria for a gap summer. Here is my
<a

 name="cvtest.pdf">CV</a> (updated August 2025).

<h3>Careerpath</h3>

After my undergraduate in mathematical physics and mathematics, followed by a master in mathematics, I recently finished my PhD this year in algebraic number theory. My thesis focuses on rational Witt spaces and their relationship with diamonds and the Fargues-Fontaine curve. 
I would like to apply my research skills in the future to a topic with more real world application.
